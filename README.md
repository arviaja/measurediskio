# measurediskio
A shell script which allows you to measure your disk I/O performance

# Dev-branch
This is under heavy development and may or may not work.

# Currently in the works:
- Split into Linux and macOS dedicated scripts: Differences are too big to be handled in one script for now.
- Rewrite the Linux side of things (ongoing)
- Rewrite the macOS side (tbd)
## Usage (is broken, since filenames have changed)
1. Copy file `measuredisk.sh` to your preferred location
2. make the file executeable: `chmod +x measuredisk.sh` (assuming you are in the same directory)
3. run: `sudo ./measuredisk.sh`

## Next:
- Write some more background.
- Provide some reference stats
- Make script less clunky
