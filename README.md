# measurediskio
A shell script which allows you to measure your disk I/O performance

## Warning !!!
*This script can potentially destroy data on your disk. Use at your own risk. Use only on spare disks or partitions!*

##
Tested on:
- MacOS 13.4
- Ubuntu 22.04
## Usage
1. Copy file `measuredisk.sh` to your preferred location
2. make the file executeable: `chmod +x measuredisk.sh` (assuming you are in the same directory)
3. run: `sudo ./measuredisk.sh`

## Next:
- Write some more background.
- Provide some reference stats
- Make script less clunky
